const aboutMeText = "Originally from New York, I moved to California in 2017 and started pursuing my degree in Computer Science and ultimately graduated UC Davis in 2022. During my tenure as a software developer, I have gained experience working in both dynamic startup environments and structured, large-scale enterprises. I've learned to adapt quickly to my environment and to be a self-starter. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, spending quality time with family, and flying a little Cessena around."
